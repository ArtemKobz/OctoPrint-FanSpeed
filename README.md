# OctoPrint-Fanspeed

Displays the print cooling fan speed in OctoPrint's nav bar.

Originally by: https://github.com/larp-welt/OctoPrint-FanSpeed

## Notes

* Numbers may differ from those displayed elsewhere due to different methods of rounding (i.e. round up, round down, ceiling or floor based rounding)
* Doesn't work with SD prints because the gcode doesn't pass through OctoPrint
* Likely also won't work if the fan speed was set via a control panel attached directly to the printer.

## Setup
